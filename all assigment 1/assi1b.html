<h2>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</h2>
<p>Jinnah's given name at birth was <strong>Mahomedali Jinnahbhai, and he likely was born in 1876,[a] to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi</strong>,[1] now in Sindh, Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's paternal grandfather was from Paneli Moti village in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat, India).[2] He was a Gujarati Khoja of Nizari Isma'ili Shiâ€™a Muslim background, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings.[3][4] After his death, his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later life to the Sunni sect of Islam. His sectarian affiliation at the time of his death was disputed in multiple court cases.[5] Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background. His father was a merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state of Gondal (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his mother was also of that village. They had moved to Karachi in 1875, having married before their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay.[6][7] Jinnah was the second child;[8][9] he had three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah. The parents were native Gujarati speakers, and the children also came to speak Kutchi, a dialect of Sindhi widely spoken in Karachi, and English.[10] Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he was more fluent in English.[11][12][13] Except for Fatima, little is known of his siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.[14] He has sometimes been referred to as a Muhajir by some writers because of his Gujarati ethnicity.[15]<strong> However, the use of the term "Muhajir", meaning "immigrant", in reference to his early life, is considered anachronistic by others as this term came into use after the partition in 1947, referring to Muslim </strong>refugees who migrated to Pakistan.[16]
